# Understanding Key Concepts in this Project

## UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
UMAP is a dimensionality reduction technique that helps in visualizing high-dimensional data in lower dimensions (like 2D or 3D). It works by approximating the structure of data and preserving local relationships, making it easier to identify patterns or clusters within the data.

## MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
MFCCs are features used in audio and speech processing. They represent the short-term power spectrum of sound and are derived from the cepstral representation of a signal. These features are commonly used in voice recognition systems and help in extracting meaningful information from audio signals.

## K-Means Clustering
K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition data into distinct groups (or clusters). It works by assigning data points to the nearest cluster center and then recalculating the cluster centers based on the new assignments. This process is repeated until the assignments no longer change, resulting in clusters that represent similar data points.

These concepts are essential for understanding how this project operates and the methodologies used for processing and analyzing the data.
